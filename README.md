# run-analytic-models
Script that can be run from the CLI to generate radio galaxy dynamical models from https://github.com/mhardcastle/analytic. This also enables the user to provide a set of observational constraints which can be fitted to the models to determine a set of radio galaxy models that describe a particular source.
